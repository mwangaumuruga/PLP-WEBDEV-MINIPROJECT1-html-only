<h1>MY FAMILY</h1><p>Contrary
 to this saying, we cannot choose 
 our family as we choose our friends. 
 But I can say that I’m blessed with a wonderful family. 
 My family is very small with four members – my mother, my father, my elder sister and me. </p><hr>
 <h2>father</h2>
 My family is a middle class family and my father is officially the bread winner of our family.<hr>
 <h2>mother</h2> My mother supports him financially by taking tuitions for school children.<hr><p>We
do not have much money or wealth but what my family has in abundance is love 
for each other which cannot be replaced by anything else in this world.
 My father and my mother are the role models to my sister and me. 
 They struggle a lot to give us a better life.</p> <h3>More than anything they have taught us 
 discipline and 
morals of life which is helping us to lead our lives in a righteous path even today.</h3>
