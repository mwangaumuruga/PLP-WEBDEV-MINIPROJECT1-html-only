Moreover, if you have your loved ones around, then there can be no greater blessing. 
You must realize the importance of your house before it gets too late. Even I never knew how 
precious my house was up until one incident that changed my outlook.

We had house help growing up. The maid who used to work for us always came early in the
 morning and would leave in the evening. Even when my mother asked her to leave early as
  she completed the work on time, she never did that. On the other hand, she used to do extra work.
   Later we found out that she never really had a house. It was just a hut which had one chair and 
   one folding. And that she liked spending time most of the time at our house because she had access 
   to all basic facilities like electricity and clean water.

This incident made me realize how I took my house for granted. It is truly an underrated 
blessing which is overlooked by others. We must value our homes before it gets too late.
