<p>Having a house is an underrated blessing. If you have not realized it yet, you can go 
    and ask any person who doesnâ€™t have a house. Only then will you realize what a great 
    blessing it is to have a house. Houses do not necessarily have to be luxuriously filled 
    with the latest amenities. A house is complete if you have a roof over your head.</p>
